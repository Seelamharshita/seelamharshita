Explanation of this C program
Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Create a header file and include the library on it.

Step 3: Create void main function.

Step 4: Declare one array and three variables.

Step 5: Create two inputs one is for the size of an array and another for taking elements in an array to create an input with help of scanf.

Step 6: Create two for loop first one for input of element and the second one for logic and conditon to count composite number.


Step 7: In for loop create if,  and else if statement for logic :

– condition of for loop = (i=0;i<n;i++),

– condition of if statement = (a[i]==2) (to continue without two because two is aa prime number),

– condition of else if statement = (a[i]%2==0) (and increment of count++ to cheak next number after incriment).


Step 8: After for loop create a if statement, and the condition is “count>2” to print the number which is divide by moe than two number.


Step 9: Print a appropiate message with the help of printf and count.

Step 10: End.

Output of this C program


In this way, we learned how to write a C program to count all the composite numbers in an array

 


<< Square of an array
Prime number in an array >>
